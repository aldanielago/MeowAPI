# MeowAPI
This is a programming project that allows users to retrieve cat pictures from an API, upload their own pictures, and save and remove pictures as favorites. The project uses HTTP requests to interact with a REST API, and leverages DOM manipulation to display images and enable user actions.

## Features
The MeowAPI Project offers the following features:

- Retrieving random cat pictures from the API and displaying them on the page.
- Uploading user-selected pictures to the API and saving them as favorites.
- Viewing and deleting pictures saved as favorites.
- Fluid and responsive design, optimized for multiple screen sizes.

## How to Use
To use this project, simply navigate to the main page and start browsing cat pictures! You can click on any picture to view it in more detail, or upload your own pictures using the "Upload" button. To save a picture as a favorite, simply click the "Add to Favorites" button, and to remove a favorite, click the "Remove from Favorites" button. All favorites are stored locally in the browser.

## Technical Details
This project uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the CatPics API. HTTP requests are made using the fetch API, and all requests are implemented with promises using the async/await syntax. DOM manipulation is handled with vanilla JavaScript, and the project includes several utility functions for managing and displaying images.

The project is designed with fluid and responsive design principles in mind, and the layout adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.
